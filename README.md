# 🚀 **Learn with me: Supervised Learning - Linear Regression with Multiple Features!**

I’m diving into **Supervised Learning** and exploring **Linear Regression** with multiple features! This recap will cover key concepts you need to understand how to build a powerful predictive model. 📊

## 📚 **Recap of Key Concepts**

1. **Cost Function for Linear Regression**  
   The cost function helps us measure the error of our model. By minimizing this error, we can improve our predictions! 🎯

2. **Gradient Descent**  
   This algorithm helps us optimize the model by adjusting weights and minimizing the cost function step by step. 🚶‍♂️➔

3. **Gradient Descent vs Normal Equation**  
   Learn how gradient descent and the normal equation approach differ. Which one to choose depends on the problem and dataset size ⚖️

4. **Feature Scaling**  
   Scaling features ensures that the model converges faster during training by standardizing the data ranges. 🚀

5. **Feature Engineering**  
   Creating new meaningful features from existing ones can dramatically improve your model's performance. 🔧

6. **Polynomial Function**  
   Going beyond linear relationships by adding polynomial terms to capture more complex patterns in the data. 📈
